# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
##implement scheduling algorithms in :
1.	Highest response ration next (HRRN) [Non-preemptive]. 
2.	Shortest remaining time first (SRTF) [Preemptive]. 
For each Algorithm: 
1.	input will be: 
	Number of processes 
	ID of each process 
	Arrival time for each process 
	Burst time of each process 
2.	Output will be: 
	The order of how the processes were scheduled to execute (Gantt Chart). Such as 
(P1 => P2 => P1 => P3…)  Average waiting time. 
	Average turnaround time. 
	For HRRN (print the updated response time after each step).
